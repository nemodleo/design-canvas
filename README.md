Easel turns a folder of plain HTML files into a design canvas. Claude Code or Codex writes a screen, and it shows up on the canvas a moment later. Drag, resize, retype or restyle anything on the canvas, and **only that part of the source file changes**. There is no export step and no proprietary file format: your designs stay in your repo as HTML and merge with git like any other code.

## Try it in 30 seconds

```bash
npx easel-canvas --demo
```

That copies the "Tidy" habit tracker demo to `./easel-demo` and opens it at http://localhost:4317. Open the **AI** tab (⌘J) and ask Claude Code or Codex for a change, or double-click a screen and start editing.

Already have HTML screens? Run it in your project:

```bash
npx easel-canvas                  # opens ./docs/design (or the current folder if it has screens/)
npx easel-canvas --init           # starts a new ./docs/design with one screen
npx easel-canvas --dir ./designs  # any folder of screens/*.html
```

## Why Easel

- **HTML is the source of truth.** Each `screens/*.html` file is one board. What you see is exactly what ships to the browser, and there's nothing to export or keep in sync.
- **Built for AI agents.** An MCP server with 20 tools lets agents see the boards, read what you selected, leave comments, check tokens and arrange the canvas. An in-app chat runs `claude -p` or `codex exec` with your selection as context.
- **Surgical edits.** Changes are patched into the exact source range (parse5 locations), so formatting, comments and the rest of the file stay untouched. If an agent edits the same element first, your edit is rejected instead of overwriting it.
- **Git-friendly by design.** Layout, notes and comments live in small JSON files written one entry per line, so two branches moving different boards merge without conflicts.
- **Local-first.** It runs on `127.0.0.1` and works directly on the files in your repo. No account, no cloud, no lock-in.

## Connect your AI agent

Keep the canvas running (`npx easel-canvas`). Agents write HTML files directly; the MCP server lets them **see** (`list_boards`, `read_board`, `screenshot`, `list_errors`), **know what you mean** (`get_selection` with the selected element, visible boards and the current page), **talk** (comments and replies) and **arrange** (`place_board`, `create_board`, notes, pages, `check_tokens`, `save_snapshot`).

**Claude Code**: add `.mcp.json` to your project root:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "easel": { "type": "stdio", "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "-p", "easel-canvas", "easel-mcp", "--port", "4317"] } } }
```

**Codex**: add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.easel]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "-p", "easel-canvas", "easel-mcp", "--port", "4317"]
default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"  # the tools only view, comment and arrange
```

Using Easel as a submodule (below)? Point `args` at `tools/easel/bin/mcp.mjs` with `"command": "node"` instead.

Then try:

> "Fix what I selected on the canvas: make the button text shorter."
> "Make three variants of the Stats screen."
> "Create an onboarding screen at 390×844 and put it next to Today."

New files with `<meta name="board-size" content="390x844">` are placed on the canvas automatically at that size.

## Pin it in your project

`npx easel-canvas` is all most projects need. To pin an exact version for your team, add it as a dev dependency (`npm i -D easel-canvas`, then `"design": "easel-canvas"` in your scripts) or as a git submodule. With your designs in `<project>/docs/design/screens/`:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/nemodleo/easel.git tools/easel
```

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "design:install": "git submodule update --init tools/easel && npm --prefix tools/easel install",
    "design": "npm --prefix tools/easel start"
  }
}
```

```bash
npm run design:install   # once: fetch the submodule and install
npm run design           # http://localhost:4317
```

- The default design folder is `../../docs/design` relative to the tool, so `tools/easel` opens your `docs/design` with no flags. Anywhere else: `npm --prefix tools/easel start -- --dir <design folder> --port <port>`.
- It installs separately from your app, so it never touches your app's dependencies, build or deploy, and CI that skips submodules (the `actions/checkout` default) is unaffected.
- To update: push to this repo, then run `git submodule update --remote tools/easel` in your project and commit the new pointer. Teammates run `npm run design:install` after `git pull`.

## How it works

```
your-project/docs/design/
├── screens/*.html   ← one board per file; agents and you both edit these
├── board.json       ← positions, titles, pages, notes, shapes (one line per entry)
├── comments.json    ← comment threads pinned to elements
└── tokens.json      ← optional design tokens and themes
```

- A small Node server watches the folder (chokidar) and tells the browser which board changed, so only that board reloads, keeping scroll and selection.
- Element paths and hashes are computed from the source with parse5. Every edit is a minimal string patch into that range, written atomically.
- The canvas is a Vite + React app. Each board is an iframe of the real HTML, so scripts, links and CSS behave exactly as in a browser.

## Development

```bash
npm test             # unit tests (source patching, board format, chat parsing, tokens…)
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright end-to-end tests against test/fixtures/design
npm run typecheck
npm run demo         # run the repo's demo from source
```

- `test/fixtures/design/` intentionally keeps Korean screen content and board titles: it mimics real user content and is needed to test Korean text input (IME) and rendering. Set `DESIGN_CANVAS_E2E_DIR=<folder>` to run the e2e tests against another design folder.
- `examples/demo/` is the "Tidy" demo used for the screenshots above.

| Folder | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `bin/` | `server.mjs` (app server), `mcp.mjs` (MCP stdio server) |
| `server/` | API and routes, board.json, file watching, element paths and hashes, source patching, history, chat runner, tokens |
| `app/` | Canvas UI (Vite + React + TypeScript); all UI text lives in `app/src/strings.ts` |
| `test/` | `node --test` unit tests and Playwright e2e tests |
